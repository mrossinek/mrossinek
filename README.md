### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am mrossinek (the `m` is soft; almost silent), a Linux enthusiast,
who spends 99% of his time using a computer, in the terminal.

I work on a variety of projects in various roles, such as being:
- a very active contributor to projects around [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit) and its [community](https://github.com/qiskit-community)
- one of the people behind [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)
  (where I mostly work on the [norg syntax](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs) and [tree-sitter parser](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/tree-sitter-norg))
- the author and main developer of [coBib](https://github.com/mrossinek/cobib)
